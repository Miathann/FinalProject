<b>The Sustainability Report</b>
<br>
Big companies report their profits in quarterly earnings reports. We think companies should be accountable for more than just profits. That’s why we send you guys our quarterly sustainability report so we can track our progress together. Sign up for our newsletters to get these in your email, or read our 2016 report, 2017 report, and 2018 report.

<br><br><br> 

<b>Refscale</b>
<br>
At Reformation we think about all the costs in creating fashion—not just the price tag. RefScale tracks our environmental footprint by adding up the pounds of carbon dioxide emitted and gallons of water we use, and pounds of waste we generate. Then we calculate how Reformation’s products help reduce these impacts compared with most clothes bought in the US. We share this information on every product page of our website and tell you exactly what impact each garment has on the environment. This way we all get to see the total cost of fashion so you can make empowered choices, and we can keep creating better solutions when it comes to making clothes.


<br><br><br> 


<b>How it works</b>
<br>
It’s all about math, and we’re super into it. The whole equation follows the lifecycle of clothes—everything from growing textile fibers and making fabric, dyeing, moving materials, manufacturing, packaging, shipping, garment care, and even recycling clothes when you’re done with them.



<br><br><br> 


<b>Offsets</b>
<br>
It's not enough just to manufacture sustainably, we also invest in programs that replace the resources we've spent, which is where offsets come in. We've partnered with the Brazilian Rosewood Amazon Conservation Project and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF) Water Restoration Program to help put back some of the resources we used. Basically, in exchange for the emissions, water and waste our clothes used last quarter, we protected 1,000 acres of the Amazon Rainforest from deforestation, contributed 27 million gallons of freshwater to critically dewatered rivers and wetlands in California, and purchased landfill gas offsets. Kinda like Venmo, but for the Earth.


<br><br><br> 


<b>The totals</b>
<br>
We also publish the totals for all the resources we used, saved, and offset. We can’t wait to see how all those little costs add up and actually make a big difference in the RefScale.</p>

	 	<b>Energy-efficiency</b>
	 		<br> 
We source electricity offsets from 100% wind power suppliers and use LED lighting and Energy Star-rated appliances in our offices.

Recycling
We recycle, compost organic wastes, and recycle or donate our textile scraps whenever possible. Zero waste is our goal. Right now, we recycle about 75% of all our garbage. Our goal is to reach over 85%. Every little thing adds up.

Our team
Over three-quarters of Reformation’s management team are women (roar!) or people from underrepresented populations.

Benefits
We provide health benefits to all full-time employees including our manufacturing team. We’ve even made getting to work part of our mission by offering Metro passes to our entire HQ team to encourage more use of public transportation.

<b>E-commerce</b>
<br>
On average, e-commerce uses about 30% less energy than traditional retail. Good news because the majority of our customers use our online site to make purchases (we’re all for never getting out of bed either). We also calculate the carbon footprint of our web server and your screen’s energy demand while browsing the Ref website. And yes, we offset that too!

<br><br><br>

<b>Hangers & totes</b>
<br>
Typical hangers are made of plastic or metal and have the lifespan of only 3 months. We use recycled paper hangers to lessen the demand for new materials and to keep junk from landfills. Americans toss 102 billion plastic bags a year. We opt for reusable totes because they lighten the load. Plus they’re way cuter.


<br><br><br>

<b>Green building</b>
<br>
It’s our mission to design innovative and eco stores. We incorporate materials like LED fixtures, rammed earth, recycled fabric insulation, and other stuff to make our stores as sustainable as possible. We also calculate the construction footprint, and offset our store builds 100%.

All our LA retail stores and HQ West are now green business certified, which basically means we’re operating using strategies that improve energy savings, water efficiency, resource stewardship, and reducing CO2 emissions. You know, all the good stuff. We’re super proud and happy to be part of the green business community of Los Angeles as well as the California Green Business Network. Learn more about it at the California Green Business Network website.

<b>Sustainable purchasing</b>
<br>
Reformation is committed to minimizing our environmental impact and achieving fair, safe and healthy working conditions throughout our supply chain. We seek to partner with suppliers who share a common vision of sustainability, accountability and transparency. We currently require that suppliers meet our standards for: social responsibility, safe & non-toxic, and better materials.

<b>Fabric</b>
<br>

To keep our supply chain as sustainable as possible, we make sure our suppliers take social and environmental standards seriously. By sourcing locally when possible, and screening all of our suppliers, we minimize environmental impacts and ensure there’s no unfair or unsafe labor that goes into making our clothes.

<br><br><br>


<b>Local manufacturing</b>
<br>
Over 65% of our cutting and sewing is done in Los Angeles and we manufacture the majority of our products in our own factory (depending on the season and the styles we're making that week). All other garments are produced by responsible manufacturing partners here in the U.S. or abroad using our same sustainable standards and materials.
<br><br><br>


<b>Purchasing</b>
<br>
Right now, the majority of our knit fabric comes from the US. The remaining is purchased from overseas suppliers. This happens when we’re unable to find anybody to make these fabrics domestically because fabric-weaving equipment for delicate wovens left the U.S. a few decades ago. Our goal is to one day bring this know-how back—both internally and domestically.

<br><br><br>


<b>Dyeing & Finishing</b>
<br>
The dyeing stage in textile manufacturing not only uses a lot of energy and water, but it also introduces the fabric to chemicals found in inks and pigments. We test all of our stuff against our Restricted Substance List (RSL) to confirm there are no hazardous substances in our products and to ensure our products are safe, and comply with international laws. Our RSL is based on the AFIRM Group industry level standards. This list applies to raw materials, finished goods and its concentrations. Download the full version of our RSL with concentration limits here.

In addition to testing all of our stuff against our RSL we currently try and work with dye houses and printers that have the following certified dying systems.

<br><br><br>


<b>BLUESIGN® system</b>
<br>
With an A+ grade in textile dyeing, Bluesign certified dyeing facilities only use safe input chemicals, monitor their air and water emissions and ensure worker safety so that the dyed fabric is safe for the end user, workers and the environment. As of 2017, all of Reformation solid silk and velvet is Bluesign certified. 

OEKO-TEX® Standard 100
Similar to Bluesign, Oekotex also checks for presence of hazardous chemicals in the dyed fabric. It checks for carcinogens, azo dyes and other chemical limits in accordance to the European REACH standards.
